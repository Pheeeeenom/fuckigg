# Fuck-IGG

Fully re-written in WPF, using Fluent Design. The app can now pull a list of the patches directly from GitHub. Also, all patches are generated as user-controls on the UI, so no more typing in the exact name. You just click the game, browse for the executable, and click done! Simple as that.
